# House Simulator
 
This project has an issue that I haven't taken the time to resolve yet, which is the fact that if a sensor is removed and then the processor tries to access it according to a rule, it breaks.
Also, be mindful of the window sizes. The project only works if the window sizes do not exceed the size of your screen.

It's currently impossible to build the executable because the main library is missing.
I will make it available in the future.
